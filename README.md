### Data Source

The primary datasets used for the analysis was gotten form the link " https://herdataproject.gumroad.com/l/supply-chain" and it contains all the information used for this project.

### Tools

- Power BI- For data cleaning and Visualization

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

### Cleaning

1. I uploaded the dataset into Power Query
2. I cheked for incorrect data type and corected them
3. Merge separated Year,Month and Day columns to create a single date column
4. Check for missing values
5. Remove duplicates

### Preparation

I created the following columns for visualization that would help with getting the result needed.

1. Month name column
2. Month Number column
3. Revenue Column.

EDA involved exploring the Supply chain data to answer the following questions

- Shipment delays and trends
- Sales by region nad product
- Warehouse Delays by Region
- Order to Shipment Delay (Days)
- Most Delayed Orders by Year

### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows
1. January,June and December have the higest order to shipment delays with numbers upto 21-23 days.
2. Less orders are shipped from the puerto rico warehouse even though the puerto rico products provides better profit margin. e.g More O Brians Men's Neoprene was prioritized over Team Golf Pittersburgh even though Team Golf Pittersburgh had better profit Margin

### Recomendations

- Focus on improving Standard Class shipping to puerto rico and USA.
- Reallocate resources to peak months to avoid delays.
- Promote faster shipment modes for high-priority products.
- Reduce use of costly same-day shipments where delays are still high (not worth the cost) particularly for January,June and December
